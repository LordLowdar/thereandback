## There and Back

## DESCRIPTION

Getting to your journeys end is certainly an accomplishment, but only because of what it took to reach there. Unfortunately that feeling pales in comparison to finally coming home and relaxing in your own bed. This makes every part of the trip important to make sure you reach your ultimate goal, to get back and reminisce on your journey and all its quirks. We aim to make this process smooth and seamless by helping you stage your tasks before, during, and after your trip. Adding points of interest to also make that trip monumental, weather status on both locations for no surprises, and a calendar to make the most of your time. We are just a few clicks away, should you stumble.

## USAGE

- Organization of task for all parts of journey
- Area based suggestions for relativity
- Time management to help maximize vacation
- We were tired of half-way apps, only concerned with getting there
- A genuinely helpful and meaningful companion
- Did not want to be lost in the vacation bliss on the way home
- One place to organize all happenings, pit stops, events, to-do's
